An employee directory but with react instead of Node.

## Overview

For this assignment, I created an employee directory with React. I broke up the application's UI into components, managed component state, and responded to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acknowledgements

So I accidentally completely trivialized this homework by finding and using material-table's and material-ui's React components. I found a table template that suited my needs and I hard-coded employee data into it. Took like, 10 minutes max. Sorry! But THANK YOU [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) for helping me build everything so quickly!
